## Adding Greek language support to the open source fonts of Cantarell

[Cantarell](https://github.com/madig/cantarell-fonts) is a humanist sans serif typeface optimized for on-screen reading. It was originally developed by Dave Crossland in the MA Typeface Design class of 2009 at the University of Reading using free software. Subsequently, it was licensed under an [SIL Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL) and has been the standard UI typeface for the open-source desktop environment [GNOME](https://github.com/GNOME) since version 3.0 in 2010. 

The fonts have been redesigned for the [release](https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.28/) of GNOME 3.28 in March 2018. Post-script outline quality improved significantly, spacing has been reworked and new weights have been added. 

The family is currently growing to support additional writing systems. After initially applying with extending another typeface I was invited to change my project and add Monotonic and Polytonic Greek to the three Roman masters of Cantarell during GSoC 2018.
