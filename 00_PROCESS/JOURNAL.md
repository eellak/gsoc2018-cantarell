<br>

**27.06.**<br />

<br>

**25.06.**<br />
- Committed feedback JPGs from Emilios Theofanous

<br>

**20.06.–24.06.**<br />
- Received feedback from Emilios Theofanous ([Cantarell_20180620_FeedbackEmilios](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/tree/master/00_PROCESS/01_Resources/01_Feedback))
- Completed the lowercase Extra Bold character set

<br>

**09.06.–19.06.**<br />
- Received feedback from Emilios Theofanous ([Cantarell_20180609_FeedbackEmilios](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/tree/master/00_PROCESS/01_Resources/01_Feedback))
- Implemented proposed correction
- Started designing Extra Bold α, η, ι, ο, π, τ, to determine if the chosen α construction works
<br>

**08.06.**<br />
- Adjusted some lowercase letters using the last test [PDF](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/blob/master/00_PROCESS/05_Test/PDF/Cantarell_20180604-1918.pdf), changed α to an alternative form
- Committed new test [PDF](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/blob/master/00_PROCESS/05_Test/PDF/Cantarell_20180608-2028.pdf) for a feedback from the mentors on lower- and uppercase character set
<br>

**05.06.–07.06**<br />
- Completed the uppercase character set
<br>

**04.06.**<br />
- Added ζ, ξ, ς to complete the lowercase character set
- Committed test [PDF](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/blob/master/00_PROCESS/05_Test/PDF/Cantarell_20180604-1918.pdf) 
<br>

**29.5.–03.06.**<br />
- Received feedback by mentor Emilios Theofanous and decided to continue in the direction set with Sketch 3
- Added lowercase characters
- Added the first uppercase non-component characters
<br>

**28.05.**<br />
- Finished a [PY-script](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/blob/master/00_PROCESS/05_Test/PY/Cantarell_TestPrint_20180528.py) to use in the open source application [Drawbot](http://www.drawbot.com) to create print test PDFs. The input [TXT-files](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/tree/master/00_PROCESS/05_Test/TXT) are stored online as well.
- Committed test [PDFs](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/tree/master/00_PROCESS/05_Test/PDF) of three digital sketches
<br>

**23.05.–27.5.**<br />
- Split my work into three sketches of different humanist directions for Greek to determine which one would work best together with Latin:
- [Sketch 1](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/blob/master/00_PROCESS/05_Test/PDF/Cantarell_Sketch1_20180528-1026.pdf): vivid, more closely related to written forms with some stroke modulation in the stems   
- [Sketch 2](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/blob/master/00_PROCESS/05_Test/PDF/Cantarell_Sketch2_20180528-1026.pdf): static, adopting some geometric construction principles
- [Sketch 3](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/blob/master/00_PROCESS/05_Test/PDF/Cantarell_Sketch3_20180528-1026.pdf): in between 1 and 2
<br>

**22.05.**<br />
- Set up components of Latin glyphs  
- Worked on α, ε, ρ, μ, ν, υ, λ, γ
<br>

**21.05.**<br />
- Uploaded first digital sketches
- Asked the mentors for feedback on the [timeline](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-cantarell/blob/master/TIMELINE.md) and included more time for kerning in the end
<br>

**14.05. – 20.05.2018**<br />
- No commit to the repository during the first week of Google Summer of Code due to EsadType’s study trip to Reading and London
- Studied resources on Greek type design provided by the mentors
*Own notes on Greek letter construction and writing directions*
